        so it's getting to be that time where i scramble to piece together some sort of idea for my senior thesis, and i've come up with the idea to make a mockup. mockups and other <i>readymade</i> design objects are curious things to me, as they pose themselves as neutral objects to be utilized by someone else for some unknown purpose â€” maybe even a...<i>layman</i> will get their hands on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        the production, distribution, and use of these <i>readymades</i> are similar to typefaces, where the type designer creates a thing, someone buys it (hopefully), and it's theirs to use however they want (within the license of course, assuming they bought it).
      </p>
      <p>
        i'll write some more about this at another time. hopefully
